# NyanCat

## Collaborators / Contributors:

* @frannyaimee Frances Renneboog


## Context: 

This is the second JavaScript exercise given by BeCode, we are to "make it rain Nyan Cats" when you press a pocture of a dog. The picture of the dog doesn't appear unless you press a button that says "woof!"
The music of Nyan cat is to play while it is raining cats and the background image should change. this should all stop after 10 seconds and the button saying "woof!" should reappear.


## Instructions
* Have you ever heard of Nyan Cat
* Create a button (like you did in the previous exercise)
* When you click the button, it should start raining Nyan Cats (Nyan cat images falling down over 45 degrees, top left to bottom right, start with one)
* Make the rain stop after 10 seconds
* While it's raining Nyan Cats, the background should become the one from the original animation and all the other elements should disappear until it's done raining cats ;)
* Where would nyan cat be without the annoying soundtrack on top of it, play the song while it's raining nyan cats

## Bonus Objectives
* Multiply the amount of nyan cats by a random amount
* Randomize the speed of the falling nyan cats
* Randomize the angle of the nyan cats
* Randomize the starting position of the nyan cats (this will make it look more like it's raining nyan cats)
